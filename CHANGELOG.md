Starting from this version, kugiri can now use itself to semi-automatically update its
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/actionutils/kugiri/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). While leveraging release notes generated by
GitHub's generate release API, it also allows manual additions to release notes without conflicting with the
auto-generated content.
